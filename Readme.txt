A Main goal of this project is to help a person control his or her expenses.

This project is under constuction and mainly is created for personal usage but is under MIT license so everybody interesed in the project may use it for free.

There are some other features which I am thinking of adding them to the project such as:
    - Ability to backup / restore inserted data.
    - Ability to backup/restore data to/from dropbox.
    - Project app by a password so it will only be accessible by who actually knows the password.
    - Listing of all expenses added to app. (Done)

Other than mentioned features there of codes need refactoring which by the time of developing will be taken care of as well.

And last but not lease, this is my first JAVA and Andorid project so do not expect a perfect application, its definetly going to have lots of problem :D .
Also that I am not a good designer, which may make the application ugly too :D .
